KingsMinigame is a Minigame I've been writing for a server, Minecraft Dieter.

It is thoroughly tested on an Offline-Mode server, so you can bet it's rock solid and feather light!

Dependencies are in lib/ folder, and also requires CraftBukkit or Spigot which are freely available online (Last compiled on spigot for Minecraft 1.8)
